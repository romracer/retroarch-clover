=== RetroArch module for hakchi ===
version 1.0

This is a hakchi/hakchi2 module which adds libretro cores and RetroArch frontend to your NES/SNES Mini.

It will automatically detect unsupported NES games and run them instead of the default emulator. Save states will work as usual.

It can also run games for other consoles. This pack already contains the following cores:

- fceumm (NES, many mappers, UNIF support)
- nestopia (NES, FDS)

Available executables and arguments:

- /bin/retroarch-clover <core> <rom> <clover_args>
  runs RetroArch with specified core,
  designed for executing from clover shell, 
  so it parses all clover arguments (saves, aspect ratio, etc.)
- /bin/nes <rom> <clover_args>
  runs "fceumm" core or "nestopia" for FDS games
- /bin/retroarch-mini [core] [rom] [args]
  runs RetroArch directly, without clover intergration
- /bin/retroarch
  RetroArch binary

Sometimes default emulator of NES/SNES mini is not working with some games when it should. So you can just add "--retroarch" command line argument to use RetroArch.
